	abstract = {Although scientific literature is accessible for citizens, it remains difficult to read for nonexperts because of its linguistic complexity and structure and lack of background knowledge for readers. Text simplification aims to reduce these obstacles. In this paper we present an overview of the SimpleText workshop at the French conference INFORSID-2021. The INFORSID'21 SimpleText Workshop addresses the opportunities and challenges of scientific text simplification approaches to improve access to information and scientific acculturation. The INFORSID'21 SimpleText Workshop relies on an interdisciplinary community of researchers in automatic language processing, information retrieval, linguistics, sociology, science journalism and science popularization working together to try to solve one of the biggest challenges of today. Five scientific papers covering the fields of medical text simplification, didactics, translation and proofreading, artificial intelligence and technical writing have been selected for publication.},
