	title = {{LIA}@{SimpleText2021}: automatic query extraction from press outlets for mining related readable passages in scientific literature},
	abstract = {We have developed a theoretical and software tool to assist science journalists in writing popular science and technology news articles. The publicâ€™s appropriation of the scientific debate and its consequences on political communication, which is often polarized or partisan, has led us to experiment with multinomial modeling in order to be able to automatically extract the associations of terms characteristic of a newspaper article with general circulation on a given period. To effectively compute these associations we compute the latent Dirichlet distributions (LDA) to a set of multinomials. We use recent implementations available in R and nonparametric correlation tests to verify the significance of associations automatically extracted by the model or formulated as hypotheses by the researcher. The detection of the vocabulary and systematic associations of a political communication is necessary for the study of the possible propagation of the ideas induced in the media, classic (such as the written press), encyclopedic (such as WikiPedia) or specialized ( such as DBLP).},
